          <h2>Our Team Visits Shanghai Jiao Tong University for HP Work Exchange</h2>
          <p>
            On May 25th, our iGEM team visited Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) for an exchange session. Our team was led by team leader and HP Group Leader Runsheng Chen, along with members Junjie Zhu, Jiming Fu, Ruoyi Zhang, and Yao Liu. SJTU was represented by team leader Qian Xinyu and HP group member Jinliang Hua.<br />
            The teams discussed Human Practices (HP) preparation, with SJTU highlighting their "Jiao Da Human Festival" and the use of separate wet lab and dry lab teams. Our team shared strategies for expanding education efforts. Both sides exchanged ideas on mentorship and knowledge transfer, inspiring future collaboration.<br />
            This exchange strengthened ties and provided new ideas for upcoming competitions.</p>

          <p>
            During the meeting, our iGEM team members and those from SJTU focused on discussing the preparation of Human Practices (HP) at both schools.<br />
            The SJTU team members emphasized the promotion of HP during their "Jiao Da Human Festival" and mentioned that their school supports the establishment of two separate teams for wet lab and dry lab experiments. These teams conduct research independently in their respective areas while enhancing collaboration between them.<br />
            Our team shared insights into the planning and preparation for the Education section, proposing strategies to expand promotional efforts and enhance the educational impact. Both teams also discussed and exchanged ideas on how to facilitate mentorship and knowledge transfer between teams from different years, which provided valuable inspiration.

          <h3>Tsinghua University iGEM Team Visits Our School for Exchange</h3>
          <p>
            On August 11th, the Tsinghua University iGEM team visited our school for an exchange activity. Attendees of this exchange meeting included our iGEM team captain, Runsheng Chen, team members Junjie Zhu and Wenkai Wang, and the two captains of the Tsinghua University iGEM team.<br />
            The exchange meeting officially began at 9:00 AM in the Bioengineering College conference room, located in Room 202 of the 18th Experimental Building at our Xuhui campus. Both teams first introduced their respective iGEM wet lab designs and Human Practices (HP) work. This was followed by a session of questions and discussions. The two teams exchanged and learned from each other's methods for selecting team members. Both teams acknowledged challenges such as insufficient time for wet lab experiments and safety concerns with live experiments. They shared their experiences on these issues and gained valuable insights.<br />
            When discussing the promotion of HP, members of the Tsinghua University iGEM team mentioned that they primarily use online platforms (such as Bilibili and Douyin) to promote their projects. In contrast, our team's HP promotional efforts are more focused on offline activities to enhance public recognition of the iGEM project.<br />
            This exchange activity fostered friendly communication between the two schools and provided both iGEM teams with additional options for team building and future work. The two teams also reached a consensus on future collaboration. Moving forward, our iGEM team will continue to advance the project and strive for excellence in all aspects. <br />
