          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            The name of our hardware is Poros-Vaccine Multipat Automated Immunization and Breeding Factory.Let's follow the eyes of a juvenile Turbot to see what it does in the factoryÔºÅ
          </p>

          <div style={{ height: '20px' }}></div>
          <p>The young turbot begins its life in a nursery pond, where it is nurtured and fed until it achieves a suitable size. Then, it is carefully transferred to an immunization pond. Here, a bacterial solution for immunization is prepared in advance, and the fish undergoes 30 minutes treatment to bolster its immune system. Post-immunization, the fish is gently transferred to a culture pond using a fish pump for further growth.<br />
            Throughout the cultivation process, an automated management system within the facility constantly monitors key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and dissolved oxygen levels via sensors. This ensures that the turbot thrive in an optimal environment. The facility's automated feeding system, which includes small robots, operates on a schedule to provide regular meals, thereby achieving precise control and significantly reducing the labor required. The feed is specially formulated with inducers to enhance the fish's disease resistance and promote growth.<br />
            The facility's primary competitive edge is its ability to automate management and regulation. By leveraging modern techniques and integrating various sensors and control systems, it minimizes manual labor in the breeding process and maximizes production efficiency. Additionally, the initial immunization in the pond prepares the fish to better combat diseases, mitigating their impact on turbot production and boosting overall yield.

          <p>
            To understand diseases and treatment methods in aquaculture and to collect samples for reference research in Shanghai, our iGEM team's HP group conducted a field survey in Qinhuangdao and Tangshan, Hebei Province, from August 5th to 7th. The team provided guidance and solutions based on the issues raised by the fisheries staff.<br />
            The survey was attended by iGEM advisors Professor Qiyao Wang and Associate Professor Yue Ma, as well as team leader and HP group leader Runsheng Chen and member Ruoyi Zhang.<br />
            The staff reported that recent fish fry deaths were due to various reasons and that traditional management methods had been ineffective. <br />
            Professor Wang and Associate Professor Ma noted that while fish disease symptoms might appear similar, they could be caused by different diseases, necessitating a change in prevention strategies. They suggested that last year's unsatisfactory immune experiment results might have been due to immunization conducted on infected or sub-healthy fish. Therefore, starting this year, the experimental approach will be modified to include quarantine before immunization.<br />
            This field survey was crucial as it allowed our team to move beyond theoretical research and engage directly with real-world challenges in fish disease management. By interacting with industry professionals and observing firsthand the practical difficulties they face, we gained valuable insights into the gaps and inefficiencies in current disease prevention and treatment strategies.
