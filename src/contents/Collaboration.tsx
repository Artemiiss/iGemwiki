          <h2>Zhejiang University of Technology iGEM Team Visits for Research and Exchange</h2>
          <p>
            On April 18th, the iGEM team from the College of Bioengineering at Zhejiang University of Technology visited our school for an exchange and learning session. The visiting team was accompanied by their instructors, Qiu Meng and Shuang Liu, along with representatives from their team. Attending from our school were Xinyi Liang, Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the College of Bioengineering, and iGEM team Secondary PIs Shuhong Gao and Pengfei Li, among others.

          <p>
            When it came to team member selection and promotional activities, our iGEM team suggested that the team's visibility could be enhanced by promoting it through school clubs, scientific innovation organizations, and various academic departments. This approach would increase student enthusiasm for participation, helping to establish a long-lasting and sustainable team. Additionally, our team proposed conducting experimental training sessions to improve students' lab skills while identifying and nurturing potential talents, thus contributing valuable experience to team building.

          <h2>Field Survey of Fisheries in Qinhuangdao and Tangshan</h2>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            From August 5th to 7th, our iGEM team's HP group conducted a field survey in Qinhuangdao and Tangshan, Hebei Province, to understand diseases and treatment methods in aquaculture and collect samples for research. The team, including advisors Professor Qiyao Wang, Associate Professor Yue Ma, HP group leader Runsheng Chen, and HP group member Ruoyi Zhang, provided guidance based on issues raised by fishery staff.</p>

          <h3>Set out</h3>
          <p>
            On August 5th, the team flew from Shanghai to Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, and visited two fisheries. Discussions with the staff focused on fish diseases, and Professor Wang and Ma suggested adjusting immunization strategies after observing disease symptoms and the management issues faced by the fisheries. Fish samples were collected for further research.

          <h3>Issues Identified</h3>
          <p>On August 6th, the team visited aquaculture bases in Tangshan. Discussions revealed that relocating northern fish fry to the south led to diseases and high mortality due to temperature changes. Professor Wang highlighted the issue of antibiotic overuse and the need for sustainable alternatives, as current treatments were costly and ineffective.</p>

          <h3>Solutions</h3>
          <p>The team proposed two solutions: controlling water temperatures to suppress disease outbreaks and using vaccines for fish immunization. They completed fish sampling and plan to return to the fishery later for further data collection and testing.</p>

          <h3>Significance</h3>
          <p>This field survey was crucial for moving beyond theoretical research, providing insights into real-world challenges in aquaculture. The team's findings, including the effects of temperature changes and limitations in disease management, will refine their research focus and inform practical solutions such as cooling systems and vaccines. The collected data will contribute to a deeper understanding of fish diseases, supporting the development of sustainable aquaculture practices.</p>
